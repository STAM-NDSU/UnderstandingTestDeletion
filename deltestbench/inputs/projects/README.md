This directory contains 7 open-source projects analyzed in our study. The projects are required as input to compute the candidate deleted tests and test deletion commits.

Please follow the following steps

1. Checkout from root directory to projects directory

```
cd deltestbench/inputs/projects
```

2. Clone open-source projects

```
git clone https://github.com/google/gson.git
git clone https://github.com/apache/commons-lang.git
git clone https://github.com/apache/commons-math.git
git clone https://github.com/pmd/pmd.git
git clone https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart.git
git clone https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time.git
git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts
```

**Note: Instead of copying all of the projects, you can copy only a single project of which results you want to reproduce :) .**
